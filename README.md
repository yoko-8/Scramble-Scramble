## Project Description
This game was created as a submission to the Basic Shmup Showcase: https://itch.io/jam/basic-shmup

At the time, this was the very first application I'd ever developed. Back then, I had very little prior programming experience aside from creating small projects in the Unity game engine (C#). I started this project when I realized that Unity and its physics engine really spoiled me, and as a result, I approached every programming challenge in terms of Unity's physics engine... which is a very narrow and self-limiting way to program.

Therefore I started looking for game engines that were the opposite of Unity. Because of how powerful and broad Unity's tools are, I realized that Unity lent itself well to very big (and unfortunately, bloated) projects. I wanted something very barebones and limiting, so I settled on Pico-8. The restrictions surrounding Pico-8 (limited token, character, and sprite count) appealed to me as I wanted to quickly assemble a small project I could be proud of.

I don't think I could have made a better decision in my journey to improve at game development and programming. Pico-8's restrictions made it necessary for me to teach myself things like object-oriented programming, writing clean code, and making arrays. I also appreciate that this project forced me to approach programming problems mathematically. Again, Unity and its physics engine really spoiled me.

All that aside, there are definitely things I feel I could have done better. I wish I had documented my game development process better, and I'm certain there's a lot of stuff I could have written more efficiently. A lot of game mechanics I wanted to put in (i.e. power-ups, more enemy types, more waves of enemies) were cut out as a result.

Overall this was a tremendously positive experience for me, and I hope you will have fun playing my game!

ALSO: big thanks to Gruber! All tracks in this game were taken from "Pico-8 Tunes Vol.2."
